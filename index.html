            <p style="margin-left: 80px;">I have to commute a lot to attend classes at Coding Elements. I don't mind. Because <br>
                 every single class has been worth the tiresome journey. So, you asked for the reviews <br>
                  for Coding Elements. And I had a lot to say. I wanted it to be a tad personal, but not  <br>
                   too much. Hence this piece.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:80px;">I think, you are one of the best teachers I've had. Probably the best. I don't know. <br>
                     I don't like to judge, but I hold you in quite high an Esteem. I think you are really good <br>
                      at teaching the things you teach, but you are also good at listening to the doubts and <br>
                       getting to the core of issues, and understanding what is really bothersome, and also <br>
                        at being patient, as the process of 'learning' has its fits and starts and patience is <br>
                         ultimately the way to go, no matter what other virtues you may have.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"> Prior to embarking on the study trip to India, I did countless hours of research and <br>
                     eventually decided to enroll in the Python and Machine learning course at Coding Elements. <br>
                      Mr. Mudit has been one of the best teachers I have learnt from in my entire education <br>
                       timeline. He is very patient when it comes to explaining ideas and would dissect content into <br>
                        easy to understand portions. Moreover, he tends to incorporate real life scenarios to make the lessons <br>
                         fun and engaging. To re-enforce our learning, Mr Mudit gives us numerous assignments which are <br>
                          discussed in the following class.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">  all the conversations we have had apart from 'Python', they were very meaningful in itself. <br>
                     And you shared freely, everything that you could, about computing and other topics, and <br> I think, this too,
                      will help me cast my career in a different light. In recent days, you have <br> become a friend,
                      a teacher and a mentor. And writing this was my way of saying 'Thank You'.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px;" >Also, the non-judgmental approach you take towards us, that's quite a relief in itself. <br>
                     It's a lot of pressure off the back of any student who is trying to master a new skill. <br>
                      I am hyperactive and it is really hard for me to keep my interest at one place for months on end. <br>
                       But, in this case, I think I'm hooked to programming for a long long time, <br>
                        thanks to you, for the way you helped structure and create my paradigm towards <br>
                         programming and the field of computing in general.</p>
